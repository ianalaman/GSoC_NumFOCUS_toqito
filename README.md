# GSoC 2025: Toqito Example Gallery (under NumFOCUS)

This repository contains my GSoC 2025 proposal and contributions for the Toqito project under the NumFOCUS umbrella. The aim of the project is to create a structured, interactive example gallery for the Toqito library using Sphinx Gallery.

📌 **Goal:**  
Provide 5–7 pedagogical and reproducible examples showcasing Toqito’s capabilities in quantum information theory — including topics like quantum key distribution, antidistinguishability, entanglement measures, and quantum circuit decomposition.

🛠️ **Technologies:**  
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, CVXPY, Sphinx-Gallery, Toqito

📄 Includes:
- Proposal PDF
- Sample/example code (once development begins)
- Links to any project deliverables and blog updates

This work is being done as part of [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) under [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).
